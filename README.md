Here is the code and data repository for the polymorphic duplication project entitled "Dosage sensitivity and duplication integrity shapes the landscape of polymorphic duplicates in Drosophila and humans".

Directory Code contains our scripts for split-read based duplication calling.

Directory Sequence contains assembled contigs and RT-PCR sequences.
